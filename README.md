# Multiple file read in AWS S3
This project is an example to show how to manipule multiple files in AWS S3. The idea happening when I needed to work with multiples files simultaneously. AWS SAM based application.


## About project:
- app - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function, in this case, a S3 object.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources, generated automatically with sam init.


## About SAM: 
The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [Python 3 installed]
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally
Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
sam-app$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `hello_world/requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
sam-app$ sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.
